An unofficial Google Plus API. Right now this consists of the following:

PHP Classes
-----------
GoogleUtil - functions for parsing the almost-JSON that Google Plus produces
PlusPerson - a person entity in Gooogle plus that can be stored to a local mysql DB
PlusRelationship - a relationship between people in Google plus. This does not contain any circle context

Tests
-----------
plususer.php - demonstrates loading and caching users, as well as traversing the social graph


API
-----------
getplusperson.php?plusid=xxx - JSON(P) API for retrieving profile data for a person.


Installation
------------
1. Copy includes/config.inc.editme to /includes/config.inc
2. Edit config.inc with your path, url and mysql information
3. Import the sql tables in the sql/ subdirectory


TODO
-----------

- pull the rest of the data fields into the PlusPerson object
- create a PlusPost object to pull and cache post data
- do something interesting with all of this
